<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>recvneo is a simple script which receives text transmitted from an AlphaSmart
Neo via the SEND button and saves it to a UTF-8 text file.</p>

<p>The SEND button works by transmitting the text from the AlphaSmart to the
computer via STDIN. I.e, the AlphaSmart "types" out the file's text to the
computer.</p>

<p>Normally, you'll use the SEND button with a text editor or word processor. This
script is a fire-and-forget alternative.</p>

<p>It was designed for the classroom, but others and myself and found use as a
very focused writing tool. It's the hardware equivalent of those distraction-free
text editors like FocusWriter.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>recvneo requires Python 2.7 and only the standard libraries. Copy the script
to somewhere in your PATH and set the executable bit (i.e., chomod +x recvneo).</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Connect your AlphaSmart to your computer with a USB cable.</li>
<li>Run this script.</li>
<li>In your AlphaSmart, go to your text file and then press SEND.</li>
<li>Wait until the text is fully transmitted and the script terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Run "recvneo --help" to learn about the command-line options.</p>
